# Goals

1. Learn to manipulate files and directory structures using the command line.
2. Learn to track changes to your code using Git version control.
3. Learn to write small programs using Python.
4. Create variables, lists, dictionaries, conditionals, methods, and functions.
5. Create strings using interpolation and concatenation.
7. Describe and use classes.

## Tasks

**Assignments Completed:**

1. Create small functions using foundational code.
2. Design a password validator.
3. Design and TDD a password manager (recorded assessment).

**Action**

To achieve these objectives, I carried out the following challenges:

- Experimented with all foundational elements of Python in the REPLIT and command line.
- Built functions in VS Code to pass through arguments and return results.
- Managed files both locally and remotely using Git. Regularly pushing and pulling repos to gain best practice for version control.
- Learned built-in methods to provide more readable and cleaner code.
- Designed the storage structure of the password manager through use of arrays nested in dictionaries.
- Understood the best way to fetch the information inside the password manager based on various commands used by the end user.
- Implemented lambda functions in my code for efficiency
- Created a final project using all the skills learned

## Result

As a result of this learning path, I was able to create the following projects:

1. [Password Validator](https://github.com/raybrowndev/password_validator/tree/main)
2. [Password Manager](https://github.com/raybrowndev/password_manager_2/tree/main)


## Reflection

**SWOT analysis of the projects produced (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats):**

- **Strengths:** Maintained clean code throughout and had peers review my work.
- **Weaknesses:** Visualising the wider scope of methods and functions in larger, real-life programs.
- **Opportunities:** Plan and diagram projects before implementation
- **Threats:** Being cautious of the UI/UX interface of work through such as; print statements and inputs.
